      Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian is often considered (within
      the Western tradition) to be the "father of history," or, by some, the
      "father of lies." Along with his contemporary Thucydides, he helped form
      the foundations for the modern study of human history. Their works
      continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused
      Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of
      contention or approach in modern historical writing. In East Asia, a state
      chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals, was known to be compiled from as
      early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived.
